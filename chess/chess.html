            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.</li>
                <li>The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under attack in such a way that it cannot escape capture.</li>
                <li>Players take turns moving one piece at a time.</li>
                <li>Players can promote a pawn to any other piece (except a king) upon reaching the opponent's back rank.</li>
                <li>Pieces move in specific ways: pawns forward, rooks horizontally/vertically, knights in an "L" shape, bishops diagonally, queen in any direction, and king one square in any direction.</li>
                <li>A player can capture an opponent's piece by landing on its square.</li>
                <li>The game can end in checkmate, stalemate, or draw by agreement.</li>
            </ul>
